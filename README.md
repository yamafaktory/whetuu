# 🌟 whetū

*whetū* is Māori for "star" — fitting, since a star (the Nerd Font glyph
`nf-md-star_face`) is the default prompt character. The binary is installed as
the ASCII command `whetuu`.

An opinionated, **zero-config** cross-shell prompt written in Zig 0.17.

There is nothing to configure: a single compiled binary renders one curated
prompt, the same for everyone. Every module runs concurrently via `std.Io`
(`Io.async` → `Future`, backed by `Io.Threaded`), so a full render — including a
`git` call and a toolchain version probe — completes in a few milliseconds.

> **Requires a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).** The prompt uses Nerd
> Font glyphs for the git branch, language logos, and the prompt character.
> Without one those glyphs show as tofu boxes.

## Modules

Left to right, each shown only when relevant:

| Module        | Shows                                                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `directory`   | Current directory, `$HOME` collapsed to `~`; keeps the anchor + as many trailing dirs as fit the width (`~/…/projects/client`) |
| `git` branch  | Branch glyph + current branch (or `(detached)`), in magenta                 |
| `git` status  | `[=conflicts +staged !modified ?untracked ⇡ahead ⇣behind]`                  |
| `language`    | Logo + toolchain version in the brand color — 39 languages & tools, detected from a project manifest (`Cargo.toml`, `mix.exs`, …), a source-file extension (`*.odin`, `*.rkt`, …), or an infra marker (`flake.nix`, `Dockerfile`, `*.tf` for Terraform/OpenTofu) |
| `cmd_duration`| Timer glyph + `<time>` when the last command ran ≥ 2 s                      |
| `character`   | A star, purple by default or in the project's language brand color — forced red after a failed command |

## Build

Requires Zig 0.17 (dev).

```sh
zig build              # binary at ./zig-out/bin/whetuu
zig build test         # run the unit tests
zig build check        # type-check only
```

Put `whetuu` on your `PATH` (e.g. copy `zig-out/bin/whetuu` somewhere on it).

## Shell setup

Add the matching line to your shell config, then restart the shell:

**fish** — `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
```fish
whetuu init fish | source
```

**bash** — `~/.bashrc` (needs bash 5+ for command timing)
```bash
eval "$(whetuu init bash)"
```

**zsh** — `~/.zshrc`
```zsh
eval "$(whetuu init zsh)"
```

`whetuu init <shell>` prints the integration script; the shell hook calls
`whetuu prompt …` on every prompt, passing the last exit status, command
duration, and terminal width.

## History

whetuu keeps its own command history — a single, deduplicated, cross-shell
store at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/whetuu/history` (or `~/.local/share/whetuu/history`).
Commands are recorded after they finish and only when they exited with status
0, so typos and failed runs never clutter the picker.
The fish integration records every command there and binds **up-arrow** to an
interactive picker; anything already typed on the command line carries over
into the picker's search field:

- **type to filter** — each space-separated word must match (case-insensitive)
- **↑ / ↓** — move the selection (↑ goes further back in time)
- **Tab** — copy the selected command into the search field (plus a trailing
  space) to edit it or append flags before running
- **Enter** — run the chosen command immediately; when nothing matches the
  search text anymore (e.g. after adding new flags), run the text as typed
- **Esc / Ctrl-C** — cancel

The list is bottom-anchored: the most recent command sits just above the search
line, older commands climb upward, each prefixed with how long ago it ran
(`5m`, `2h`, `3d`). The selected row is highlighted full-width in the
prompt's star purple. The picker draws on `/dev/tty`, so nothing but the chosen
command reaches stdout. Duplicates are collapsed; there is no configuration.
All three shells (fish, bash, zsh) record into the shared store.
